📊 Sentiment Analysis on Customer Service Tweets using NLP
🔹 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to classify customer service tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. It combines text preprocessing, VADER-based sentiment labeling, TF-IDF feature extraction, and machine learning models such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes to achieve reliable sentiment classification.

🎯 Objectives

Preprocess and clean raw Twitter text

Label sentiment automatically using VADER

Transform text into numerical features with TF-IDF

Train and compare multiple machine learning models

Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning

Evaluate performance using standard metrics

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

NLTK

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, WordCloud
