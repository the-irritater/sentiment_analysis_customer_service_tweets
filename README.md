# sentiment_analysis_customer_service_tweets
This project builds an end-to-end NLP pipeline to classify customer service tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. It applies text preprocessing, VADER-based labeling, TF-IDF feature extraction, and machine learning models such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, with hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation.
